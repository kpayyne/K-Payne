                 <p>The reason why my motto is Movie Mode, becasue everything I do is a movie. If it has to do with having a camera in my hand, taking photos, making a highlight tape or even a music video. Their all forms of movies in my head.<br/>The other aspects why I use that name is because it brings life into the name. A sort of lights camera action feeling to it.<br/>I am also called K-Payne because that was my old rap name and stayed with it. </p>
