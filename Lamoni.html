			 <h1 style="background-color:tan;">MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
				 <h2 style="color:white;">The experience I have been having here has been quite well other then the fact that I am in the middle of no where. I had to learn how to adjust to the farm life but at the same time I accoutered new experience I will never forget. Being out here also gave me the opportunity to focus on school other then partying. If I was at a Division 1, I feel like I would get lost in the mix and caught up in something. One of the things that bother me while I am out here, is the distance from my family. Being away for my family can be lonely at times but I try to find ways to maneuver around that. </h2>
